# WordPress Admin Toggle Browser Extension

Super simple browser extension that navigates the user to `/wp-admin` for the current tab
when clicking the browser extension. This is packaged for use on Safari, but the `Shared (Extension)/Resources`
folder is a generic Browser Extensiont that can be packaged and used in any browser if you'd like. 

PRs welcome!
